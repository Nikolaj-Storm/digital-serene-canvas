            <h2>Research Impact and Applications</h2>
            <p>This dashboard has been instrumental in several major research initiatives, providing insights that have informed strategic decisions at both institutional and policy levels. University administrators have used the platform to identify emerging research areas and potential collaboration opportunities, while funding agencies have leveraged its analytics to assess the impact of their investment strategies.</p>
            
            <p>The tool has been particularly valuable in interdisciplinary research contexts, where traditional bibliometric approaches often fall short. By providing nuanced visualizations of cross-disciplinary citation patterns and collaboration networks, the dashboard has helped identify previously unrecognized connections between fields and highlighted emerging areas of interdisciplinary research.</p>

        <section class="project-technical fade-in">
            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>The dashboard leverages a robust technology stack designed for scalability and performance. The backend processing engine uses Python with pandas for data manipulation and NetworkX for network analysis. The visualization layer is built with Plotly and Streamlit, providing responsive, interactive charts that work seamlessly across devices.</p>
            
            <p>Data integration capabilities allow the platform to work with multiple academic databases and citation indices, ensuring comprehensive coverage of research output. Advanced caching mechanisms and optimized query structures ensure rapid response times even when processing large datasets.</p>
